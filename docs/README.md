# Ingress documentation and examples

This directory contains documentation.

## File naming convention

Try to create a README file in every directory containing documentation and index
out from there, that's what readers will notice first. Use lower case for other
file names unless you have a reason to draw someone's attention to it.
Avoid CamelCase.

Rationale:

* Files that are common to all controllers, or heavily index other files, are
named using ALL CAPS. This is done to indicate to the user that they should
visit these files first. Examples include PREREQUISITES and README.

* Files specific to a controller, or files that contain information about
various controllers, are named using all lower case. Examples include
configuration and catalog files.

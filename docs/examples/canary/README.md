# Canary

Ingress Nginx Has the ability to handle canary routing by setting specific
annotations, the following is an example of how to configure a canary
deployment with weighted canary routing.

## Create your main deployment and service

This is the main deployment of your application with the service that will be
used to route to it

```bash
echo "
---
# Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    app: production
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: production
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: production
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: production
        image: registry.k8s.io/ingress-nginx/e2e-test-echo:v1.1.3@sha256:77e8f7aa7e5651409cbe4ca38430e61828873c7df325e6f83c7345e34011f6b2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
          - name: NODE_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: spec.nodeName
          - name: POD_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.name
          - name: POD_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          - name: POD_IP
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: status.podIP
---
# Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    app: production
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
  selector:
    app: production
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Create the canary deployment and service

This is the canary deployment that will take a weighted amount of requests
instead of the main deployment

```bash
echo "
---
# Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: canary
  labels:
    app: canary
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: canary
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: canary
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: canary
        image: registry.k8s.io/ingress-nginx/e2e-test-echo:v1.1.3@sha256:77e8f7aa7e5651409cbe4ca38430e61828873c7df325e6f83c7345e34011f6b2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
          - name: NODE_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: spec.nodeName
          - name: POD_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.name
          - name: POD_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          - name: POD_IP
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: status.podIP
---
# Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: canary
  labels:
    app: canary
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
  selector:
    app: canary
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Create Ingress Pointing To Your Main Deployment

Next you will need to expose your main deployment with an ingress resource,
note there are no canary specific annotations on this ingress

```bash
echo "
---
# Ingress
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: production
  annotations:
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: echo.prod.mydomain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: production
            port:
              number: 80
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Create Ingress Pointing To Your Canary Deployment

You will then create an Ingress that has the canary specific configuration,
please pay special notice of the following:

- The host name is identical to the main ingress host name
- The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"` annotation is required and
  defines this as a canary annotation (if you do not have this the Ingresses
  will clash)
- The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "50"` annotation dictates the
  weight of the routing, in this case there is a "50%" chance a request will
  hit the canary deployment over the main deployment
```bash
echo "
---
# Ingress
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: canary
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: \"true\"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: \"50\"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: echo.prod.mydomain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: canary
            port:
              number: 80
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Testing your setup

You can use the following command to test your setup (replacing
INGRESS_CONTROLLER_IP with your ingresse controllers IP Address)

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -s --resolve echo.prod.mydomain.com:80:$INGRESS_CONTROLLER_IP echo.prod.mydomain.com  | grep "Hostname"; done
```

You will get the following output showing that your canary setup is working as
expected:

```bash
Hostname: production-5c5f65d859-phqzc
Hostname: canary-6697778457-zkfjf
Hostname: canary-6697778457-zkfjf
Hostname: production-5c5f65d859-phqzc
Hostname: canary-6697778457-zkfjf
Hostname: production-5c5f65d859-phqzc
Hostname: production-5c5f65d859-phqzc
Hostname: production-5c5f65d859-phqzc
Hostname: canary-6697778457-zkfjf
Hostname: production-5c5f65d859-phqzc
```

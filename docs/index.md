# Overview

This is the documentation for the Ingress NGINX Controller.

It is built around the [Kubernetes Ingress resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), using a [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) to store the controller configuration.

You can learn more about using [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) in the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://docs.k8s.io).

# Getting Started

See [Deployment](./deploy/index.md) for a whirlwind tour that will get you started.
